            <div class="article-content link-primary">
                <p>This privacy policy describes information that is collected when you use this website. It is written in plain English, rather than legalise. “Site” refers to this website, www.security.kiwi.</p>

<h2 id="information-collected">Information Collected</h2>
<p>We only collect information about you if we have a reason to do so. For example, to provide our Services, to communicate with you, or to make our Services better.</p>

<h2 id="information-you-provide-through-actions">Information You Provide Through Actions</h2>
<p>It’s probably no surprise that information is collected when you provide information. The amount and type of information depends on the context. Here are some examples:</p>

<p><strong>Email Signup</strong>: If you sign up for a newsletter you will share informaiton about yourself via the signup form, including your name and email address. Further information is collected when you interact with emails which are sent to you, for example, if you have opened the email to create aggregate statistics on the email open rate.</p>

<p><strong>Transaction and Billing Information</strong>: If you buy an item you will provide personal and payment information that is required to process the transaction. This includes your name, credit card information, and contact information.</p>

<h2 id="information-collected-automatically">Information Collected Automatically</h2>
<p>Some information is collected automatically:</p>

<p>Usage Information: Information about your usage of this website. For example, information about the actions users perform – in other words, what you did, when and to what thing on a site (e.g. a button click). Information is also collected about what happens when you use this Site (e.g., page views) along with information about your device (e.g., screen size, name of cellular network, and mobile device manufacturer). This information is used to, for example, provide services to you (e.g. enabling purchases), as well as get insights on how people use this website, so it can be improved.</p>

<p><strong>Location Information</strong>: The approximate location of your device from your IP address is used by our web analytics platform, Google Analystics. This information is used to, for example, calculate how many people visit this website from certain geographic regions.</p>

<p><strong>Information from Cookies &amp; Other Technologies</strong>: A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor’s computer, and that the visitor’s browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. Pixel tags (also called web beacons) are small blocks of code placed on websites and emails. This website uses cookies and other technologies like pixel tags to help identify and track visitors, usage, and access preferences, as well as track and understand email campaign effectiveness and to deliver targeted ads.</p>

<h2 id="how-and-why-your-information-is-used">How and Why Your Information is Used</h2>
