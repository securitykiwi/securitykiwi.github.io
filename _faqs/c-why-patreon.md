#### Why Patreon? Why not an eBook?

Patreon lowers the barrier to entry. An eBook would cost many times more than the Patreon pledge and book-video bundles cost many times more on top of that (~$90+). This Patreon-supported model allows the majority of the content to be free and supports future development over the long term by providing me a more consistent income for me to write, design, build and test.
