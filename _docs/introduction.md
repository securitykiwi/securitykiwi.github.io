This course teaches machine learning concepts and techniques through practical tutorials and plain-English explanation, culminating in projects focsued on cyber security. Projects such as: email malware collection, facial recognition for OSINT and threat prediction and others. _Much of the course content is freely accessible_, learners can support content development and gain access to screencast walkthroughs, downloadable workbooks, Q&A and more through <a href="" target="_blank">Patreon</a>.

## Designed to Reduce the Learning Curve

The course approaches machine learning in a reader-friendly manner, designed to reduce the learning curve - _you don't need to be good at math to learn here_. We consider the stages of a machine learning project: designing a system, data gathering, choosing an algorithm, training a model, evaluating and tuning the model to obtain the best performance. The aim of this is to help learners into a project-oriented state of mind as you learn to improve the chances of success beyond the course. Additionally, the course considers how people learn and implements <i>multimodal</i> learning through a mixture of text, graphics, video, code and Q&A, designed to help students learn efficiently. As time goes by, quizzes, live walkthroughs, more videos and among other additions will be available.

If you are new to programming, python or security, _this is not a barrier which should stop you_. I encourage you to try and experiment. The course provides working code and practical workflows - you don’t need to be able to program to copy. However, the greater your understanding of code, the greater your ability to move beyond the examples and apply the ideas to your projects. A page in this introduction section is dedicated to a short <a href="/docs/python-refresher/" target="_blank">Python Refresher</a> if you need it.

Why "course" and not "book" or "site"? I want the learner to <a href="/docs/how-to-approach-learning/" target="_blank">actively engage in learning</a>, as you would in a course taught in a classroom. Here, unlike a book, you have _access to a tutor_ (for lack of a better word) - I encourage you to <a href="/contact/" target="_blank">send me any questions</a> you have. Learning materials such as video walkthroughs, downloadable workshops and Q&A are available to Patreon supporters, in addition to votes on content and the access to the community. Once Security Kiwi becomes sustainable, I plan to add live walkthroughs, animation and more (keep reading).

## Let Me Introduce Myself

Hi, I’m Kris. I was fortunate to study computer science and cyber security at undergraduate and graduate level respectively. Both of my dissertations explored machine learning; one seeking to use an academic natural language processing (NLP) algorithm in the then new TensorFlow; and the other, on the feasibility of using indicators of compromise (IoC) for projecting attacker behaviour within networks. I am not an expert on machine learning, however, I can share what I have learned over my years of education and tinkering.

I taught myself machine learning starting with my undergraduate project. I found the information in the public domain was limited; it had a steep learning curve and much of the information was confined to the academic journals only accessible to students and researchers. While some of this has changed - high-quality books now exist - much of the innovation in machine learning relating to cyber security is _still confined to academic journals_ (and private companies) and barriers around ease of understanding still exist (i.e lots of math). This course is derived from academic research, books, my education and my own learning with the aim of being as easy to understand for those with limited math skill. The result is a course anyone can follow and self-teach machine learning for security from scratch.

## What's in the Course?

The structure of the course follows three conceptual areas:

* **Foundations**, we learn foundational theory and implement tutorials to understand,
* **Practical projects** we create interesting security-related projects, such as email malware collection systems, intrusion detection systems and more to come,
* **Resources**, information to help you to move beyond the course content and provide detailed information on specific algorithms, datasets and subjects such as how to conduct research.

As time goes by the content will be further refined and more intermediate and advanced material will be added. _New content is added twice per month_, on the first and third thursday of the month. For the month of January (2021) new content will be added _weekly_.

The course is freely accessible, I don't like the idea of putting heafty financial barriers in front of knowledge. The course is an on-going effort, made financially viable through Patreon. In return readers gain access to material to increase the efficiency of learning; screencast walkthroughs, downloadable workshops, Q&A etc. Eventually, live walkthroughs and more. Typically, programming books cost $40 USD and video courses cost from $90 USD onwards. To obtain all of the materials for this course on Patreon it costs $12 /mo. Downloadable content is DRM free, so you can keep it if you decide to stop supporting. For supporters who don't want video or downloads, just to say thanks for the free content, gain access to the Q&A and a few patreon-only perks the first tier is $7 /mo.

## Design, Conventions and Elements

A great deal of effort has gone into the creation of the course from a design point of view, both in terms architecture of the course and the aesthetic of the website. Both of these elements alter how effective the learning experience is. 

The architecture of the course draws on <a href="/docs/how-to-approach-learning/" target="_blank">research</a> to consider how humans learn to ensure learners gain as much as possible as they learn. We start with plain English, I attempt to use simple English, without 'dumbing down', to reduce fatigue and make the content friendly to non-native English speakers. The concept of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition" target="_blank">spaced retention</a> is used to refer back to foundational knowledge as learners progress. 

Good design aids <i>multimodal learning</i> - that is the combination of a number of learning 'styles'. Text is augmented by graphics, videos and code. I intend to add live video walkthroughs, quizzes, animation and other helpful elements over time. Colour-blind users benefit from a research-derived <a href="https://personal.sron.nl/~pault/#sec:qualitative" target="_blank">colour palette</a>. I intend to further improve accessibility, using CSS and text rather than images where possible, and to make all pages available as audio recordings, for example. Please <a href="/contact" target="_blank">get in touch</a> with accessibility suggestions and feedback.
