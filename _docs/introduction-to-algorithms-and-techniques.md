This section aims to provide learners with a library of detailed information on the most popular machine learning algorithms in use today. Each entry is introduced in a begineer-friendly way, but does not shy away from technical detail. Eventually, each entry will also be accompanied by a tutorial implementing the technique in python.

## Algorithm Library

* Convolutional Neural Network (coming 21st January)
* Decision Tree (coming soon)
* Deep Belief Network (coming soon)
* Recurrent Neural Netork (coming soon)
* Regression: Linear (coming soon)
* Regression: Polynomial (coming soon)
* Regression: Logistic (coming soon)
* <i>More coming</i>

Many more algorithms and techniques will be added over time.
