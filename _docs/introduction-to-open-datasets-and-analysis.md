This section aims to provide learners with a library of open datasets useful for cyber security purposes, along with analysis of each describing their strengths and weaknesses. While the analysis cannot be exhausive (due to the number of applications), the analysis will be useful to beginner and intermediate learners looking for appropraite datasets for experimentation and their own projects.
