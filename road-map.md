    <li>Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)</li>
    <li>Decision Tree</li>
    <li>Deep Belief Network (DBN)</li>
    <li>Regression</li>
    <li>Support Vector Machine (SVM)</li>
    <li>k- Nearest Neighbours (kNN)</li>
    <li>Random Forest</li>
    <li>And more.</li>
</ul>

Eventually, the Open Datasets & Analysis section will include:

<ul>
    <li>URG16</li>
    <li>DARPA 1998/99</li>
    <li>KDDCup 1999 </li>
    <li>Sperotto 2009</li>

    <li>And more.</li>
</ul>

Additionally, not listed in the contents currently are pages on Preprocessing, Feature Engineering, and further pages on TensorFlow and Keras, among others. These will be created in the near future. Projects on a number of subjects will be created: Automated Email Malware Collection, Facial Recognition for OSINT (Open Source Intelligence) and Attack Prediction/Projection, among others. Projects are designed to be useful tools, interesting and the core learning be applicable to other projects you may have. If you have an idea for a project theme, please <a href="/contact">get in touch</a>.
